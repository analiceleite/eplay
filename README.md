# Eplay - Game Shop
Eplay is a dynamic game store application built using modern web technologies. This project showcases my skills in React and Next.js, along with state management and API integration.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has been customized to fit the needs of the Eplay Game Shop.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A powerful tool for managing application state with efficient API handling through `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.
- **Formik**: A library for managing form state and validation.
- **Yup**: A schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- **Styled-components**: A library for writing CSS in JavaScript.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation within the application.
- **React Spinners**: For adding loading indicators.

## API Integration

Eplay consumes a custom fake API built with Next.js, allowing for dynamic data retrieval and efficient state management. This setup ensures that the user experience is seamless and responsive.
